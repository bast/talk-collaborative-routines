Efficient collaborative routines for teams

we are flooded with email, Slack, Gitter, Trello, Hangouts, Skype, issue
tracking, Twitter, mentions, mailing lists, forums, wiki, documentation,
Overleaf, meetings, deadlines, all while constantly switching context between
several projects - how can we stay on top of things and manage and contribute
to code projects without making our heads explode

---

## Goals

- Communicate
- Track progress
- Track issues
- Meet and discuss
- Decide
- Write
- Coordinate
- Ask questions

---

## Issues

- Lifetime
- Owner
- Public
- Close to the repository
- Mentions

---

## Zenhub, Gitlab

---

## Trello

Problems:

- Hierarchy of tasks is hard to track and visualize
- Dependencies between tasks
- Disconnected from the source code

---

## Slack

- If something requires action, use email
- Slack sprints to get people connected
- Problem with transcontinental flight in a busy team
- Invite only
- Old messages lost

---

## Forum

- Answers can be organized

---

## EMail

- Default if no other medium agreed
- Invisible to next generations
- Changing subjects
- Too long
- No control of whether you want to follow an issue or not
- No lifetime for issues
- Too much
- Not clear who owns it
- Who do I need to include?

---

## Mailing list

- Hard to search
- Hard to see what problems are still open

---

## Routines

- Agree on channels
- Document your channels (every team will agree on something else)
- Use the right channel
- Do not duplicate information
- Sometimes an issue discussion grows into another channel
- Hard to see what problems are still open

---

## C4 process (shortened, cite Hintjens)

- Use a distributed version control
- Use a web platform
- Use an issue tracker
- Only maintainers should have push access to the repository
- Patches must adhere to contribution guidelines
- Work on forks
- Maintainers shall not accept their own patches
- Maintainers shall not make value judgments on correct patches

---

## Contribution guide

- Code style
- Testing policy
- Licensing and copyright transfer
- Commit messages
- Code review policy
- Changelog policy
- Feature branch base point
- PEP
