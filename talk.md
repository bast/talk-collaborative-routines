### How can we stay on top of things and manage and contribute to code projects without making our heads explode?

---

## Teamwork is about .red[communication]

### Discuss .red[scaling] with respect to .red[team size] and .red[number of teams]

---

layout: false

class: split-50-50

## Goals

.column[

- Answer questions
- Meet and discuss
- Make decisions
- Documentation

### Coordinate

- Track progress
- Track issues
]
.column[
### We wish to avoid

- Confusion
- Ignorance
- Double work
- Idling
- Wasting time
]

## Email

- Default if no other medium agreed

### .red[What are problems with emails?]

---

## Email

- Default if no other medium agreed

### Problems

- Too much, too many, too soon, too long
- Often changing subjects
- No control of whether you want to follow an issue or not
- No clear lifetime for issues ("is this issue still relevant?")
- No clear owner ("is this already fixed?")
- Easy to write to the wrong audience (forget somebody or reply all)
- Lost knowledge for people who will join your team later

## Forum

- Answers can be organized
- Not ideal to track issues or progress
- Popular: [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org)

## Mailing list

- Hard to search
- Hard to see what problems are still open
- Popular: [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com) (possibly not reachable from China)

---

## [Slack](https://slack.com) (team chat)

### Problems

- Out of sight, out of mind
- Old messages get lost
- Invite only
- Problem with transcontinental flight in a busy team

### Suggestions

- If something requires action, use email
- Agree on Slack times when people are available to get teams connected

### Alternatives

- [Gitter](https://gitter.im) (unlimited history, open to join)
- [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com) (open source)

---

## Issues

### Advantages

- Clearly defined lifetime (auto-close with commit messages)
- Clearly defined owner
- Close to the repository (cross-referencing)
- Easy to follow/unfollow
- Easy to reference later
- @mentions

### Suggestion

- Make issues public

---

## [Trello](https://trello.com)

### Advantages

- Intuitive and lightweight task tracking

### Problems

- Hierarchy of tasks is hard to track and visualize
- Dependencies between tasks
- Disconnected from the source code

### Would be nice to have "Trello functionality" closer to the code

## Efficient meetings

- Debug the technology (Google Hangouts works)
- Have an agenda, make it accessible, distribute it before the meeting
- Be on time and stay on time (respect and cost)
- Take minutes (people who are not able to attend, should get the chance to be informed)
- Use **live minutes** (Google Doc which everybody in the meeting can view and edit live at the same time in the same place)
- Keep the document as a record/trace
- Document decision points and todo items
- Todo items need to have an owner
- If relevant, transfer todo items to your progress tracking
- If you are paid by public money, be transparent about your minutes

---

## Routines

- Agree on channels
- Document your channels (every team will agree on something else)
- Use the right channel
- Do not duplicate information
- Sometimes an issue discussion grows into another channel

---

## C4 process (shortened, cite Hintjens)

- Use a distributed version control
- Use a web platform
- Use an issue tracker
- Only maintainers should have push access to the repository
- Work on forks
- Patches must adhere to contribution guidelines
- Maintainers shall not accept their own patches
- Maintainers shall not make value judgments on correct patches

---

## Contribution guide

- Code style
- Testing policy
- Licensing and copyright transfer
- Commit messages
- Code review policy
- Changelog policy
- Feature branch base point
- Proposals

---

## Toolbox (shortened, cite Hintjens)

- Strong mission
- Transparency
- Remixability
- Strong protocols
- Fair authority
- Smooth learning
- Minimalism
